# Knowledge Base Instructions

## Structure
The knowledge base is a loosely structured collection of articles in markdown files. The root of the knowledge contains the following main folders:
- **library**: Useful general information on various topics, such as:
  - Development practices
  - Programming languages
  - Frameworks
  - Standard definitions
  - ...
- **project**: Project-specific information, such as:
  - Project name and version
  - Project summary (short description)
  - Roles and people
  - Timeline
  - Online repository
  - ...
- **stories**: User stories implemented, in progress, or to be done. Each article contains one user story only with the following structure:
  - **Title**
  - **User Story**
    - Body (the user story itself)
    - Status
    - Dependencies
    - Notes
  - **Acceptance Criteria**
  - **References**
  - **Keywords** (list of relevant keywords)

## User Stories

### The Title
- Should be **clear and concise** (e.g., `US101 - Enable Dark Mode for Improved User Experience`).
- Include the **US identifier** (e.g., `US101`).

### The Body
- Written in the **standard format**:
  ```
  AS A [role]
  I WANT [goal]
  SO THAT [benefit]
  ```
- Focus on **user intent** and **value**.

### The Status
- Possible values: `DONE`, `TO BE DONE`, `IN PROGRESS`, `BLOCKED`.
- Indicates the **current state** of the user story.

### Dependencies
- List any **dependent user stories** (e.g., `US100` for `US101`).
- Helps track **implementation order**.

### Notes
- Provide **technical details**, **implementation guidance**, or **edge cases**.
- Should **not** include acceptance criteria (keep it separate).

### The Acceptance Criteria
- Structured as **scenarios** with:
  - **Given** (preconditions, if any).
  - **When** (user action).
  - **Expect** (observed result).
- Use **bold** for keywords like `WHEN`, `EXPECT`, and `GIVEN`.
- Ensure **testability**: Each criterion should be verifiable.

### The References
- Link to **external sources** (e.g., GitHub issues, design documents).
- Helps trace **requirements back to discussions**.

### Keywords
- Add a **"Keywords"** section **at the end** of each article.
- Include **relevant keywords** to improve searchability and categorization.

## Rules
- Do not create anything directly under the root.
- Under the main folders, articles can be organized in subfolders, although this is not mandatory.
- When creating a new article, ensure it includes a **"Keywords"** section listing the most relevant keywords.
- Every article can be fully referenced by its parent folder(s) and filename.
